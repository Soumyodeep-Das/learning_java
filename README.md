# learning_java
Hey there !

I'm Soumyodeep. An Computer Science student, deeply passionate about 
technology,

I'm learning Java from scratch. I do have knowledge of programming
languages such as C, Python. As the syntax of Java is pretty similar
with C that's why learning Java became more easier to me.

In this repository, I'm uploading all my Java codes that I used to
practice while learning it.

The codes may not be in a sequential form as I had to put the index
of the programmes at the end of its name, because Java isn't supporting
a class name staring with numerical values.

Thank You for visiting my Repo !!ðŸ’›ðŸ’›
