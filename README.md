Hey there !

I'm Soumyodeep. A Computer Science student, deeply passionate about technology,

I'm learning Java from scratch. I do have knowledge of programming languages such as C, Python. As the syntax of Java is pretty similar with C that's why learning Java became more easier to me.

In this repository, I'm uploading all my Java codes that I used to practice while learning it.
